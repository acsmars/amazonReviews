# Amazon Reviews Bias Analysis

This tool for analyzing large data sets was designed and used to search for bias in reviews from Amazon.com

The data for this analysis was generously provided by Julian McAuley at the University of California at San Diego. See citation below and more information here: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html

# Procedure

This program parses line deliniated JSON data into a list of dictionaries, then groups performs simple statistical analysis on that data. The data is then plotted using Plotly. Many parameters are included to limit the number of points that Plotly needs to display, which is vital to making the graphs viewable.
